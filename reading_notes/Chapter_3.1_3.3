Oscillatory Motion and Chaos:
3.1 Simple Harmonic Motion:
Consider a simple pendulum of mass m connected by a massless string to a rigid support. There are only 2 forces acting on it, Gravity and Tension. We can assume that the parallel forces equal to 0.
The perpendicular force is given by: F=-mg sin(theta). 
Newtons second law gives, F = m(d^2s)/dt^2. where s = length*theta.
We get our equation of motion as (d2theta)/dt^2 = -g*theta/l
With w as angular velocity, we can obtain the equations,
w(i+1)=wi - (g*theta/L)*dt and theta(i+1) = thetai + wi*dt
