Oscillatory Motion and Chaos:
3.1 Simple Harmonic Motion:
Consider a simple pendulum of mass m connected by a massless string to a rigid support. There are only 2 forces acting on it, Gravity and Tension. We can assume that the parallel forces equal to 0.
The perpendicular force is given by: F=-mg sin(theta). 
Newtons second law gives, F = m(d^2s)/dt^2. where s = length*theta.
We get our equation of motion as (d2theta)/dt^2 = -g*theta/l
With w as angular velocity, we can obtain the equations,
w(i+1)=wi - (g*theta/L)*dt and theta(i+1) = thetai + wi*dt
3.2 Driving Force
adding dissipation and nonlinearity makes the pendulum system more complex and interesting
**Damped Pendulum Equation**:
$$\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + 2\beta\frac{d\theta}{dt} + \omega_0^2\sin\theta = 0$$
**Underdamped Solution**:
$$\theta(t) = e^{-\beta t}(A\cos\omega_d t + B\sin\omega_d t)$$
where \( \omega_d = \sqrt{\omega_0^2 - \beta^2} \) is the damped natural frequency.

**Forced Damped Pendulum**:
$$\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + 2\beta\frac{d\theta}{dt} + \omega_0^2\sin\theta = F_0\cos(\omega t)$$
where \( F_0 \) is the amplitude and \( \omega \) is the frequency of the external force.

**Steady State Solution**:
$$\theta(t) = \theta_s\sin(\omega t + \phi)$$
where \( \theta_s \) is the steady state amplitude and \( \phi \) is the phase shift.

**Amplitude and Phase Equations**:
$$\theta_s = \frac{F_0}{\sqrt{(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2)^2 + (2\beta\omega)^2}}$$
$$\phi = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{-2\beta\omega}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2}\right)$$

**Resonance Condition**:
Resonance occurs when the driving frequency \( \omega \) is close to the natural frequency \( \omega_0 \), leading to large amplitudes.
